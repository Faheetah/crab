# 🦅 Predator

Focuses on physical damage, meat progress, and dash skills related to closing the gap. Hybrid evolutions typically include speed buffs. The branching evolutions Legs and Wings are found under Predator and Prey.

Play style revolves around hunting down enemies and dealing physical damage as fast as possible. As there is a lack of defensive abilities, picking up some evolutions from Prey or Imposing is very important. Legs or Slithery are very strong, allowing greater speed. Progress is mainly from killing other enemies.

Synnergizes well with Imposing, which gives a bigger HP pool to soak hits, and includes the Body Slam move that scales with HP and physical damage.

# 🐭 Prey

Primarily defensive focusing on dodge and small size, as well as finding food, especially vegetation. The branching evolutions Legs and Wings are found under Predator and Prey. Ruminant is also found under Prey, periodically giving progress for each level of Prey.

Play style can vary based on other evolutions chosen, but typically is either avoiding damage outright and foraging, or picking up physical or ability damage skills and strafing around enemies doing quick damage. Dodge can easily exceed the 75% cap with prey. High levels can be achieved by stacking progress evolutions and exploring, especially with Fungoid, Ruminant, and Carrion. Prey is highly effective in WWW, allowing dodging bosses and picking up their drops.

Synergizes with predator or trickster well as an agile damaging boost. Prey is also a great choice for Gregarious, as it allows dodging attacks while charmed enemies do all the damage.

# 🦊 Trickster

All of the ability based attacks are found under Trickster, with Beak being the only ability damage evolution that has another affinity (Prey). In addition to ability attacks, evolutions focus on mobility through terrain and attack penaltiy reductions and speed. Three of the six branching evolutions are found under Trickster, with Tentacles and Arms unlocking two Carcinisation evolutions: Pincer and Pistol Pincer. Slithery is the third branching evolution, providing a speed boost and reducing terrain penalty.

Play style is based on quick attacks and movement, moving laterally around bosses while continuing to attack uninterrupted. Several evolutions also add poison damage, which along with high Ability, can deal tremendous damage over time.

Synergizes with Prey for dadded defenses and speed, and Gregarious as supplemental damage which can be very helpful for early game.

# 🐘 Imposing

High health and huge size are central to Imposing evolutions, allowing for size and health pools close to boss levels. A few physical attacks are found in the affinity. Plating and damage resist are also found on a few evolutions. One Carcinisation ability, Shell, is found here which adds damage resist and unlocks Turtle Down.

Play style is generally large size and physical damage, especially with the Imposing evolution: Body Slam. When combined with Hump early in the game, large health pools exceeding 400HP can be attained, and can reach 999HP, which scales with Body Slam, allowing one shotting bosses with the right damage buffs. Imposing can also be used to enhance defenses for other play styles and is rarely a detriment to any build.

Synergizes with Predator the best, but can be used with Trickster and Gregarious. Prey, aside from a few abilities, detracts as it lowers size, but can make for a very defensive build stacking all four defense types.

# 🐝 Gregarious

The smallest affinity in terms of evolution count, Gregarious is the sole affinity providing the ability to charm enemies. Two of the three evolutions boosting senses are found in Gregarious, with one also being found in Prey. Several evolutions also boost social, which increases the chances of charming, and increases the damage of Toe Beans, the only non physical and non ability based attack.

Play style varies heavily, with aggressive and passive play styles being viable. Getting Tail early is very beneficial as it not only adds to social, but allows aquiring +social buffs from mud pits.

Synergizes well with any of the other affinities, but has the most crossover with Prey or Trickster. The Alpha evolution boosts Gregarious, making Gregarious evolutions more common.

# 🌿 Unaffinitied

Some skills do not have a related affinity. Typically these evolutions are related to food progress, heat/cold resist, and day/night damage. These evolutions do not drastically affect one affinity more than another and are generally utility evolutions that deal with the environment more than other enemies.
